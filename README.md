        - interrupted, wasn't a fan of the style of the tutorial -- copied and pasted all the code from github to experiment, but only dabbled; moving on.

### Thoughts

- I like tutorials where, after each section, a `cargo check` both identifies errors, and potentially directs next needed thing. This is _not_ that kind of tutorial.

- Would be curious to re-implement this in [Warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp).
